  ”'We are the Uruk-hai; we do not stop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm.'”
notes: 'This card''s special ability makes the twilight cost of an Uruk-hai -1 for
  each Uruk-hai you spot other than this card. For example: if you have four Uruk
  Regulars in play and you use the special ability on one of them to play an Uruk
  Searcher (twilight cost of 4), the Searcher''s twilight cost is 1.'
