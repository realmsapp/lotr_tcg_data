  Plays to your support area. Each time Legolas wins a skirmish, you may place an [Elven] token on this card. While you can spot X [Elven] tokens on this card and the same number of [Dwarven] tokens on My Axe Is Notched, Legolas is strength +X (limit +3).
notes: 'The strength bonus derived from this condition is based on the lowest number
  of tokens on either card. For example: If there are two [Elven] tokens on Final
  Count and three [Dwarven] tokens on My Axe Is Notched, the strength bonus is +2.'
