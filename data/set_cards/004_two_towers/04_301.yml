  Ring-bearer (resistance 10). While you can spot 3 unbound companions, Shadow cards may not discard cards from your hand or from the top of your draw deck.
flavor_text: ! |-
  ”'But as for us, we are Hobbits of the Shire, far to the North and West, beyond many rivers.'”
notes: 'This card only prevents Shadow cards that make you discard from hand or draw
  deck. If a Shadow card gives you a choice, you may choose to discard. For example:
  if a Dunlending Rampager is played, Courteous Halfling does not prevent the Free
  Peoples player from discarding. Since the game text of the Rampager says “may discard,
  ” a choice is provided.'
