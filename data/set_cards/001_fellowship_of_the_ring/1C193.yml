  Plays to your support area. Response: If your [Moria] weapon is discarded, play it from your discard pile (that weapon's twilight cost is -1).
flavor_text: ! |-
  The Goblins of Moria have oft plundered the deep armouries of Durin's folk.
notes: If a minion bearing a [Moria] weapon is discarded due to losing a skirmish,
  Plundered Armories takes effect before optional actions triggered by winning/losing
  that skirmish occur. When an effect discards “all” minions (thereby discarding their
  weapons), they are discarded at the same time. None of those minions may have weapons
  played on them with Plundered Armories.
